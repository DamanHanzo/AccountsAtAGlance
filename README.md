Following PluralSight course: Making an application using ASP.NET MVC, EF CodeFirst, jQuery and Google Services

## Technologies Used

1. Client-Side Technologies
	* HTML5
	* Modernizr: Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects which HTML5 and CSS3 features your visitorâ€™s browser supports. In detecting feature support, it allows developers to test for some of the new technologies and then provide fallbacks for browsers that do not support them. This is called feature detection and is much more efficient than browser sniffing.
	* jQuery: Used for UI development.
	*Canvas: Native plugin used for charting.
	*SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics.
	*CSS3: Use some of the new features like transtions etc.
	*JavaScript Patterns: The Revealing Module Pattern is based on a pattern referred to as the Module Pattern. It makes reading code easier (in my opinion anyway) and allows it to be organized in a more structured manner. The pattern starts with code like the following to define a variable, associate it with a function and then invoke the function immediately as the script loads. The final parenthesis shown in the code cause it to be invoked.
